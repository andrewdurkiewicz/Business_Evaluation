Types of errors
	random errors and supidity lol
approximation errors or algorithmic erros 
	should decrease as you run more loops
round off errors 
	finite precision for floats 
	not known exactly
	can accumulate over time
	fractions are not their exact decimal counterparts
subtractive cancelation
	given a = b - c
	then the error adds up, and for a smaller a, we get a larger prefactor (b/a) (c/a), thus the error can be large still
	given b~C we have the largest error possible.
